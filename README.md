## 👋 hello

In sports, every centimeter and every second matter. That's why Roboflow decided to 
use sports as a testing ground for our computer vision models. This repository contains 
reusable tools that can be successfully applied both in sports and beyond.

**code migration in progress...**

We don't have a Python package yet. Install from source in a
