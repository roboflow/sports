## 👋 hello

In sports, every centimeter and every second matter. That's why Roboflow decided to use sports as a testing ground to push our object detection, image segmentation, keypoint detection, and foundational models to their limits. This repository contains reusable tools that can be applied in sports and beyond.

## 🥵 challenges

Are you also a fan of computer vision and sports?  We welcome contributions from anyone who shares our passion! Together, we can build powerful open-source tools for sports analytics. Here are the main challenges we're looking to tackle:

- **Ball tracking:** Tracking the ball is extremely difficult due to its small size and rapid movements, especially in high-resolution videos.
- **Reading jersey numbers:** Accurately reading player jersey numbers is often hampered by blurry videos, players turning away, or other objects obscuring the numbers.
- **Player tracking:** Maintaining consistent player identification throughout a game is a challenge due to frequent occlusions caused by other players or objects on the field.
- **Player re-identification:** Re-identifying players who have left and re-entered the frame is tricky, especially with moving cameras or when players are visually similar.
- **Camera calibration:** Accurately calibrating camera views is crucial for extracting advanced statistics like player speed and distance traveled. This is a complex task due to the dynamic nature of sports and varying camera angles.

## 💻 install

We don't have a Python package yet. Install from source in a
[**Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/roboflow/sports.git
```
